This folder includes the code to reproduce the results in: \
**``Channel Normalization in Convolutional Neural Network avoids Vanishing Gradients''**, by Zhenwei Dai and Reinhard Heckel, ICML workshop 2019.

**one_dim_net_convergence_paper.ipynb** includes the code to run gradient descent on deep decoder, multi-channel CNN and linear CNN; \
**Visualize_loss_function_landscape.ipynb** plots the loss function landscape of multi-channel CNN and linear CNN; \
**distribution_gradient_linear_network_initialization_3.ipynb** plots the gradients norm at initialization (with Normal distribution) for both multi-channel CNN and linear CNN.
